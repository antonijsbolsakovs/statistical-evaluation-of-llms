# Preserving Linguistic Diversity in the AI Era  
**Analyzing English Intrusion in Danish LLM Outputs**

## Overview
This project investigates how English words intrude into Danish-language outputs of large language models (LLMs), focusing on Google Gemini 1.5 Flash and 2.0 Flash.  
We conducted a statistical evaluation of model responses across multiple categories (STEM, FAQ, Riddles, Creative, etc.), using methods such as correlation, ANOVA, Association Rule Mining, and Mann-Whitney U tests.  

Key finding:  
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** shows a significantly stronger correlation between response length and English word usage than Gemini 1.5 Flash.  
- This highlights potential risks for **linguistic diversity** in smaller languages when using advanced LLMs.

## Methods Used
- **Association Rule Mining (FP-Growth)**  
- **Pearson Correlation** (response length vs. English intrusion)  
- **Two-Way ANOVA** (effects of model & category)  
- **Mann-Whitney U Test** (non-parametric comparison)  
- **Shapiro-Wilk Test** (normality check)  

---

## Results
- Gemini 2.0 Flash introduces **more English words** in Danish responses compared to 1.5.  
- Stronger correlation between **response length** and English usage in STEM and FAQ categories.  
- English intrusion includes both **general vocabulary** and **technical terms**, raising concerns about bias toward English.
